# focus
Block and unblock websites with a simple command

## Usage
To block all websites specified in the hosts/block file for XXX seconds:
```focus -b XXX```

To unblock all websites: ```focus -u```


### Functionality
This script works by changing the /etc/hosts file. This means writing permissions are needed for this script to work.

When blocking or unblocking websites the /etc/hosts file is replaced with the hosts/block or hosts/unblock files respectively. The hosts/blocktime file stores the time up to which the websites can't be unblocked using this script

This script is not ment as a secure way to prevent accessing websites. It's just a way for me to make it harder to get distraced, which should help me remain focused for longer.
